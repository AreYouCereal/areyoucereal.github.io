So. Here I sit...err...actually, I admit it, I'm laying down...working on this blog. Truth be told, it's quite the undertaking...however, this is simply a post to ensure i am actually <em>doing</em> it right. Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could do dry runs like this...in life...as it pertains to emotional matters? Kinda like if you could run a code for "does this person have compassion?"...because when you <em>open in browser</em> and you get the dreaded <em>404, Page Not Found</em> page, at least you are pretty confident with your next decision as it pertains to that person. Wow, i think i just might be on to something here....ummmm.
