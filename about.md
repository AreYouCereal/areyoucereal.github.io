you wanna know about me?

Um. Well...I'm first (and most importantly) a mom to an amazing little guy. He's 12 and is truly my reason for waking everyday. Okay, i admit, some days are more challenging than others, but, not for reasons you might suspect.

My son, Tate, was diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome when he was 10. I always knew he was on the autism spectrum...perhaps because when he was 18 months old, (<em>and not walking because he hated the way his feet felt on the floor</em>) we hit a snag...long story short, he was diagnosed with Sensory Integration Disorder at the age of 6 months. I knew this put him on the autism spectrum, and i read everything I could about it so that i could follow and document his milestones and his setbacks.

What I know now is that I am so grateful I was filling my head with the good stuff. A lot of people hear AUTISM and panic..."oh my gosh my child will never fufill the dreams i have for him"...to people with that reaction I say, <bold>they were never your dreams in the first place</bold>...they are your child's, so how about waiting for <em>them</em> to decide what the dreams actually are?

I want to say this about my son: he is the <em>smartest</em> person I know. Must I remind you he is 12? Often I find myself asking HIM for answers to things i probably (read: should) know...and everytime, he's spot on with the answers.

So why in the heck am I working full time, attending MakerSquare alongside of that (for an intense 10 week front-end development boot camp? 

<em>Because I'm Crazy</em>
Crazy enough to prove to myself that A) I can do this; B) Prove to my son that a single mom is no less than any other breathing person on the planet; and lastly, C) Because i have to prove to myself that I can do this.

And you know what?
I'm doing just that. In this moment. Right here...proving i can do this.
