I'm glad that you actually want to give me a shout out--so please, do so! Send me a friend request on facebook, give me a chirp at twitter or do it the (ahem), old fashioned way, with a simple email. Looking forward to it. Be nice. Please.

Honestly, i look forward to the requests, emails and tweets i receive. I mean, not that I have gotten a ton (read: any), but just think...you could be the <em>first</em>.
