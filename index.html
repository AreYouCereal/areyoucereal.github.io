  <p>Okay, I admit it. I honestly don't think my life is that interesting, but I certainly know that it is hilarious for a number of reasons. I mean, the things that happen to me, um, don't normally happen to <em>anyone</em> i know. Perhaps that is why my friends and family have encouraged me to start a blog..but let's be honest...i never intended to actually <em>start a blog</em> until it became a requirement in my <a href="http://www.MakerSquare.com">MakerSquare</a> bootcamp. Funny how that happens, right?  Well, have a few meaningless posts that are doing nothing more that teaching me <em>how in the hell</em> to lay these pages out. So, until I actually have something interesting say, i simply tell you: DO NOT JUDGE ME BY THE DESIGN OF THIS...yet...still trying to learn all the HTML, CSS, javaScript, jQuery and so on and so forth. MAY THE FORCE BE WITH ME ... okay, and you too.
