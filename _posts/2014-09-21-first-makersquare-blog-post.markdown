Okay, trying to be positive here, so let me just say this kindly...I hate GIT. Well, it's a love hate relationshhip. Meaning, when it does as I ask of it, i love it. When it stumps me to the point of pulling every hair out of my head, i loath it. Um, I might just be in over my head.
However, this girl loves a good challenge. It's funny...as soon as frustration with git is about to takeover, i find myself engrossed in the process. Some people might not like learning...i happen to love it...when it is going my way. When it is not and i cannot find the answers to my questions anywhere is when I feel defeated. But then, I simply pull up Elyse's email and she always has the answer...in a very helpful way. Love that. Really loving the journey thus far. Let's pray i can find a way to get GIT on Team Wendi.
